'''
There is a stone game.At the beginning of the game the player picks n piles of stones in a line.
The goal is to merge the stones in one pile observing the following rules:
At each step of the game,the player can merge two adjacent piles to a new pile.
The score is the number of stones in the new pile.
You are to determine the minimum of the total score.
Example
For [4, 1, 1, 4], in the best solution, the total score is 18:
Merge second and third piles => [4, 2, 4], score +2
Merge the first two piles => [6, 4]ï¼Œscore +6
Merge the last two piles => [10], score +10
Other two examples:
1.  [1, 1, 1, 1] return 8
2.  [4, 4, 5, 9] return 43
